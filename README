 Introduction
-----------------------
This suite is to check system core processes.
# Usage for each file (under ivi-dist-bat-tests folder):
<sub-folder>   <usage>
src            source file of the cases

# Needed package/command
gcc make  --- common packages for make 
autoconf --- A GNU Tool for Automatically Configuring Source Code
automake --- A Program for Automatically Generating GNU-Style Makefile.in Files
rpm-build --- for packaging

-----------------------
Build and Run
-----------------------
(Suppose you only get the source code and testkit-lite has been setup on your test machine
 if you have got ivi-dist-bat-tests RPM, you can directly go to step.4 on testing machine
 if you don't have testkit-lite, you can get it from https://github.com/testkit/testkit-lite)

Steps:
1. cd ivi-dist-bat-tests
2. sh pack.sh    --- It will make and generate the ivi-dist-bat-tests RPM
3. rpm -ivh ivi-dist-bat-tests-0.1.0-1.i386.rpm    --- install RPM to your testing machine 

To run cases, you can either do step.5 or step.6
4. testkit-lite -f /opt/ivi-dist-bat-tests/tests.xml --comm localhost -o ./results.xml
